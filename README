This is a simple script because I saw the idea of monitoring failed jobs at
http://goo.gl/enkjI however I really didn't want to implement an unnecessarily
complex, multi part, compiled java program on my nagios hosts to perform this
same check. I added a couple features as well such as listing the failed jobs
and the time they had last run as well as allowing you to specify a single job
to check which will return OK|CRITICAL for that job alone.

INSTALL 
-------

This was built and tested on a few different Ubuntu 10.04 servers and on one Ubuntu 9.10 server. This script requires python argparse and pymssql modules. 

These can be installed on ubuntu 10.04 by running: sudo apt-get install python-argparse python-pymssql 

On Ubuntu 9.10 I had to use easy_install from python-setuptools package to install argparse. 9.10 has a package for pymssql but the version it provides doesn't seem to work so I compiled pymssql myself on 9.10 and the package worked. 

I'm sure you can find packages to install argparse and pymssql on most all other Linux distros but I don't know the commands and I haven't tested it. 

You need to specify a SQL Server user to connect to the server which must be a an actual SQL Server user (cannot use Windows Auth or Active Directory). This user must be able to perform a select on msdb..sysjobs and msdb..sysjobhistory.
